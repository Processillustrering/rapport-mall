Abstract, always in English, about 10-20 lines. Do not use references, and do not use formulas if they can be avoided.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the problem/issue/subject?
\item How was the problem solved/attacked?
\item What are the results, how well was the problem solved?
\item How good are the results, how useful are they?
\end{enumerate}
The abstract should be understandable without reading the whole report (and the rest of the report should be understandable without reading the abstract). You can reuse text/phrases from the Introduction.
